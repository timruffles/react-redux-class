## Why's am I excited about React + Redux?

## It takes longer to make apps
{bad:1}

## Boiler-plate

## I've observed inferior performance
{bad:1}

## Virtual DOM

- Additional layer of abstraction vs jQuery or Vanilla

##Â Redux

- Slower and wasteful of memory vs mutating objects

## I've found simple things hard
{bad:1}

## I have to think loads about my data-structures

## and the structure of the app

## It makes sharing data a puzzle


## But...

## ...longer to start, wins medium to long

## ...locally slower, globablly faster

## ...easy things harder, hard things possible
