# React + Redux class

Thank you for choosing to attend my class!

Today we're going to be building apps with React + Redux. Please ensure you have:

- Chrome
- Node >= 6.9.1

To install all dependencies (may take a while, so best to do it early as possible), simply run `npm install`.

## Credits

Aside from the dependencies of the project (see node_modules etc), this class uses:
